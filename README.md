# Deep Learning Notes

Welcome to my Deep Learning Notes repository! This collection contains detailed and structured notes created while learning deep learning from various free online resources, practical tutorials, and hands-on implementations. The notes cover both theoretical concepts and practical implementations using Python, Keras, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.
